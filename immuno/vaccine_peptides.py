# To clarify the nomenclature (source seq vs. peptide vs. epitope)
# look at this example.
#
# Let's say we have a small protein with this 48 residue sequence:
#
#   TAADMAAQTTKHKWEAAHVAEQLRAYLEGTCVEWLRRYLENGKETLQR
#
# and a somatic variant results in the a single amino acid change
# of the first 'A' for a 'Q', then our mutated protein will be:
#
#   T[Q]ADMAAQTTKHKWEAAHVAEQLRAYLEGTCVEWLRRYLENGKETLQR
#
# now either this full protein or some subset of it will become
# the 'SourceSequence' depending on how large of a vaccine peptide
# we're aiming to generate. If, for example, we only want 15-mer
# vaccine peptides, then the SourceSequence will be the union
# of all 15-mer windows containing the modified residue. In this
# case, since the change was near the start of the protein, there
# are only two such windows, yielding a SourceSequence of length 16:
#
#  T[Q]ADMAAQTTKHKWEA
#
# From this source sequence, we generate shorter substrings we
# expect to bind to MHC molecules (typically 8-11 residues).
# Assuming for simplicity that epitopes will all be 9-mers,
# the set of epitopes will be:
#
#  T[Q]ADMAAQT
#  [Q]ADMAAQTT
#  ADMAAQTTK
#  DMAAQTTKH
#  MAAQTTKHK
#  AAQTTKHKW
#  AQTTKHKWE
#
# We look at the scores for each of these epitopes to generate
# scores for the 15-mer peptides which contains these epitopes.
# So, the first peptide "TQADMAAQTTKHKWE" contains all but the
# the last epitope, and the second peptide "QADMAAQTTKHKWEA"
# contains all but the first epitope.
