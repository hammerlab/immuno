    Given a dataframe with a 'combined_score' for each short epitope
    create another dataframe of all longer vaccine peptides ranked by the
    median score of epitopes involving mutated amino acid residues minus
    epitopes which are unmodified by a mutation.

    Parameters
    ----------

    epitopes_df : pandas.DataFrame
        Must contain columns:
            - 'SourceSequence': window around the mutation in a protein
            - 'MutationStart': first mutated residue in the SourceSequence
            - 'MutationEnd' : last mutated reside in the SourceSequence
            - 'Epitope': short subset of the SourceSequence
            - 'EpitopeStart' : start position of epitope
            - 'EpitopeEnd' : end position of epitope
            - 'combined_score': score for the epitope
            - 'chr': chromosome of original DNA variant
            - 'pos': position  in the chromosome
            - 'ref': reference nucleotide(s) at `pos`
            - 'alt': alternate nucleotides found at `pos`
            - 'info': gene name and/or ID
            - 'stable_id_transcript': which transcript of the gene

    peptide_length : int
        How long should the subsets of SourceSequence be?

    min_peptide_length : int, optional
        If a SourceSequence is shorter than peptide_length, should we use it?
        Omitting min_peptide_length sets it equal to peptide_length.

    Returns a new dataframe with columns:
        - 'Peptide':  amino acid sequence composed of multiple epitopes
        - 'SourceSequence' : longer amino acid sequence from which
            peptide was extracted
        - 'MutatedScore' : median score of epitopes with mutations
        - 'SelfScore' : median score of epitopes without mutations
        - 'Score' : log2(MutatedScore / SelfScore) if SelfScore > 0, else -inf
        - 'MutationStart' : first mutated reside in the peptide
        - 'MutationEnd' : last mutated residue in the peptide
        - 'chr': chromosome of original DNA variant
        - 'pos': position  in the chromosome
        - 'ref': reference nucleotide(s) at `pos`
        - 'alt': alternate nucleotides found at `pos`
        - 'info': gene name and/or ID
        - 'stable_id_transcript': which transcript of the gene

            # To clarify the nomenclature (source seq vs. peptide vs. epitope)

            # Let's say we have a small protein with this 48 residue sequence:
            #
            #   TAADMAAQTTKHKWEAAHVAEQLRAYLEGTCVEWLRRYLENGKETLQR
            #
            # and a somatic variant results in the a single amino acid change
            # of the first 'A' for a 'Q', then our mutated protein will be:
            #
            #   TQADMAAQTTKHKWEAAHVAEQLRAYLEGTCVEWLRRYLENGKETLQR
            #
            # now either this full protein or some subset of it will become
            # the 'SourceSequence' depending on how large of a vaccine peptide
            # we're aiming to generate. If, for example, we only want 15-mer
            # vaccine peptides, then the SourceSequence will be the union
            # of all 15-mer windows containing the modified residue. In this
            # case, since the change was near the start of the protein, there
            # are only two such windows, yielding a SourceSequence of length 16:
            #
            #  TQADMAAQTTKHKWEA
            #
            # From this source sequence, we generate shorter substrings we
            # expect to bind to MHC molecules (typically 8-11 residues).
            # Assuming for simplicity that epitopes will all be 9-mers,
            # the set of epitopes will be:
            #
            #  TQADMAAQT
            #  QADMAAQTT
            #  ADMAAQTTK
            #  DMAAQTTKH

            #  AAQTTKHKW
            #  AQTTKHKWE
            #
            # We look at the scores for each of these epitopes to generate
            # scores for the 15-mer peptides which contains these epitopes.
            # So, the first peptide "TQADMAAQTTKHKWE" contains all but the
            # the last epitope, and the second peptide "QADMAAQTTKHKWEA"
